    "high": "\\begin{HighFinding}\n\\textbf{[H-1] Password Storage on Public Blockchain}\n\nAll data stored on-chain is visible to anyone. The \\passthrough{\\lstinline!PasswordStore::s_password!} variable can be read directly from blockchain storage, completely breaking the protocol's privacy.\n\\end{HighFinding}\n\n**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severely breaking the functionality of the protocol.\n\n**Proof of Concept:** The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain.\n\n1. Create a locally running chain:\n   ```bash\n   make anvil\n   ```\n\n2. Deploy the contract to the chain:\n   ```bash\n   make deploy\n   ```\n\n3. Run the storage tool (slot 1 for `s_password`):\n   ```bash\n   cast storage <CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE> 1\n   ```\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain.\n\n\\begin{HighFinding}\n\\textbf{[H-2] Missing Access Control on setPassword()}\n\nThe \\passthrough{\\lstinline!PasswordStore::setpassword!} function lacks \\passthrough{\\lstinline!onlyOwner!} modifier, allowing anyone to change the password and break the contract's intended functionality.\n\\end{HighFinding}\n\n**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract, severely breaking the contract intended functionality.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control conditional to the `setPassword` function.",
