# Protocol Summary

A simple password storage smart contract for secure credential management.

# Disclaimer

The TACITVS team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

| **Likelihood** \ **Impact** | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** |
|:---------------------------|:--------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| **High**                   |    H     |    H/M     |    M    |
| **Medium**                 |   H/M    |     M      |   M/L   |
| **Low**                    |    M     |    M/L     |    L    |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

# Executive Summary

**Objective:** Comprehensive security review of password storage mechanisms

| Severity | Count |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| üõë High  |  0  |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium |  2  |
| ‚ö° Low   |  1  |
| ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info  |  3  |
| **Total** | **6** |

**Key Risk Areas:**
Unauthorized access to stored passwords, potential storage vulnerabilities

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
Implement additional access controls and encryption layers

## Issues Found

| Severity | Number of issues found |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| High     | 0         |
| Medium   | 2       |
| Low      | 1          |
| Info     | 3         |

# Findings

## High

No critical vulnerabilities identified.

## Medium

Access control mechanisms could be strengthened. Consider implementing role-based permissions.

## Low

Minor optimization opportunities in gas usage patterns.

## Informational

Documentation could be enhanced. Consider adding comprehensive inline comments. Event emission patterns could be optimized.
